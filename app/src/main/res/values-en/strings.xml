        <item>On your homescreen your tasks will be shown on the right side, while on the left side you can see your timetable of the current day, as long as you fill it in.</item>
        <item>In the timetable section you can enter your lessons, the teacher for each subject and even the room for each lesson individually. In addition, you can also set the scoring of the written grades in comparison to the oral grades. It is important that the ratio is correct, as it is important for the calculation of your overall score.</item>
        <item>In this area you can see your overall average in the upper right corner. Further down you will see your average in each subject, if you have entered enough notes. With a click on each subject you can also view the individual, registered notes incl. scoring.</item>
        <item>You can add a new note by clicking on the Add button at the bottom right. After you have selected the subject in which you got the note, you can still distinguish between oral and written notes, as well as how the note is specially rated in the subject, in case of helplessness simply tap on the question mark at the right edge of the line. If you want to add something to this note, you also have the option of adding a small text.</item>
        <item>You can enter homework as well as tests and simple notes for each subject. These will appear on your Home screen under each subject.</item>
        <item>Here you can see your calendar, with all the school dates. Alternatively you can of course create a new appointment yourself with description, place and end date/time. These will be shown to you in the calendar like the school dates. </item>
